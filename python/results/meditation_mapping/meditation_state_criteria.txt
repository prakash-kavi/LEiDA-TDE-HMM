MEDITATION STATE CHARACTERISTICS
===============================

This document provides criteria for manual mapping of HMM states to meditation phenomenology.

FOCUS
-----
Neural Signature:
- High DAN and FPN activation (z-score > 0.5)
- DMN deactivation (z-score < -0.5)
- Strong DAN-FPN coupling (correlation > 0.2)
- Strong DMN anticorrelation with task-positive networks
- Relatively long state lifetime
- High self-transition probability
Research Support: Hasenkamp et al. (2012), Brewer et al. (2011)

MIND WANDERING
-------------
Neural Signature:
- High DMN activation (z-score > 0.5)
- Low attention network (DAN, VAN, FPN) activation
- Strong within-DMN coupling
- Weak or positive DMN coupling with attention networks
- Variable state lifetime (shorter in experienced meditators)
Research Support: Christoff et al. (2009), Mason et al. (2007)

META-AWARENESS
--------------
Neural Signature:
- High VAN activation (z-score > 0.5)
- Moderate FPN activation (z-score > 0)
- Strong VAN-FPN coupling
- Brief state duration
- Often transitions from Mind Wandering to Shifting
Research Support: Hasenkamp et al. (2012), Malinowski (2013)

SHIFTING
--------
Neural Signature:
- High VAN and DAN co-activation
- Moderate FPN activation
- Low DMN activation
- Brief transitional state
- Often precedes Focus state
Research Support: Hasenkamp & Barsalou (2012), Malinowski (2013)

REFOCUSING
---------
Neural Signature:
- High DAN activation
- Moderate to high FPN activation
- VAN activation transitioning to DAN dominance
- Transitional state (often shorter than Focus)
- Strong anti-correlation with DMN
Research Support: Hasenkamp et al. (2012), Lutz et al. (2008)

MAPPING GUIDANCE
---------------
1. Prioritize network activation patterns and interactions over temporal metrics
2. Consider group differences - meditators may show more distinct state separation
3. Some states may not fit perfectly into a single category - note these as 'hybrid' states
4. For k=4 models, expect to find Focus, Mind Wandering, Meta-Awareness and a combined Shifting/Refocusing
5. For k=5 models, all five states may be identifiable
6. Document your reasoning for each mapping decision
